# There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each 
# containing m integers. You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the 
# integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0. For each i integer in the array, 
# if i=A(i belongs to A) , you add  to your happiness. If i=B(i belongs to B), you add -1 to your 
# happiness. Otherwise, 
# your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

# Note: Since A and B are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array 
# might contain duplicate elements.
